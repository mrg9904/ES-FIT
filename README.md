# An ellipsometry spectropy data analysis project for isotropic materials
This is a multi-parameter fitting program to convert the ellipsometry raw data, ψ and Δ, to the optical function n and k, as well as film thickness. The fitting procedure is based on the built-in simulated annealing function in MATLAB.
